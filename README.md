# Reinforcement-Learning

The work was based on the research article "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Systems: A Review of Challenges, Solutions and Applications". 

In this article, the authors propose an overview of the history of reinforcement learning, set the framework and theoretical bases, explain the use of deep learning in reinforcement learning, introduce the Multi-Agent framework and list the main challenges, solutions and applications associated with it.

Our work will therefore follow the following outline:

- Preliminaries on Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Multi-agent framework and non-stationarity


Finally, this report will be accompanied by a Notebook in which we propose a small implementation of a collaborative game illustrating our work, and in particular
another problem mentioned in the article: partial observability.
